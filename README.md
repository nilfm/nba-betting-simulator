# nba-betting-simulator

Website to simulate NBA bets.

Every day it posts the new games and checks the scores of the past day's games.

### Ideas

* Make the bets via AJAX request so it doesn't reload the page
* Javascript to dynamically inform the user of the potential winnings of each bet
* Ranking takes into account money spent on pending bets
* Search user function
* Follow user function
* Two rankings: all players and people you follow
* Pagination in both rankings and user's bets
