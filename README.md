# nba-betting-simulator

Website to simulate NBA bets.

Every day it posts the new games and checks the scores of the past day's games.

The website is available <a href="http://nbabettingsimulator.com">here</a>.

### Ideas

* Make the bets via AJAX request so it doesn't reload the page
* Javascript to dynamically inform the user of the potential winnings of each bet
* Pagination in both rankings and user's bets
* Add game details - link to game summary from CBS sports, etc
* Ask for confirmation before resetting/deleting account
* Popup to reset account if ranking_funds == 0
* Improve elasticsearch parameters
