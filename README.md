# NBA Betting Simulator

Website to simulate NBA bets.

Every day it posts the new games and checks the scores of the past day's games.

The website is available <a href="http://nbabettingsimulator.com">here</a>.

### Technologies used

* Python (Flask) for the backend
* Javascript and VueJS for the frontend
* Elasticsearch to search users (fuzzy search and prefix search)
* Deployed on DigitalOcean droplet (Linux server)

### Ideas

* Javascript to dynamically inform the user of the potential winnings of each bet
* Add game details - link to game summary from CBS sports, etc
* Option to email user an HTML summary of their stats:
  * By team (show the best and worst team for the user)
  * By home/away
  * By likely/unlikely bet
